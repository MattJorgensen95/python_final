# python_final
The final project for python data analytics

For the final project, we will be finding a dataset to work with to demonstrate our ability to use Python in data analytics. First we’ll find a publicly available dataset from a reputable source. Then we’ll "Ingest the data” by importing it into Python. Then we’ll clean the data and document the cleaning steps in our code. Then we’ll manipulate the data to prepare it for analysis with operations like sorting, filtering, grouping, merging, or reshaping the data. Then we’ll visualize the data using Matplotlib or Seaborn to make appropriate charts. After all of that we’ll conduct our statistical analysis with descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and/or distribution analysis. This README file will be used to document our project and code in addition to inline comments.

Below are the datasets I'm thinking about using:

This is the dataset I used for the Excel final project. I couldn't get the date formatting to work in Excel, and it would've been a nightmare to do all the logic and string manipulation in an Excel cell to make the dates work. It would be cool to go back to this dataset and look at the data over time since it would be way easier to make the awkwardly-formatted dates usable in Python.

This would be another cool dataset to work with. It's pretty simple and easy to read. The documentation is kind of lacking though because it doesn't say where this data was collected from. I could go with this dataset for the ease of use, or look around some more to find one with more relevant information and context.
